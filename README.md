# Firebase Cloud Function Example

ðŸ‘‰ Introduction Cloud Functions: https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions

The project uses Cloud Functions to perform Cloud Messaging with the help of Realtime Database. All Firebase.

This Cloud Function example monitors a directory in the Firebase Realtime Database for newly created records.
When the record is created the Cloud Function triggers the Cloud Messaging process and sends the message to the Topic, any device subscribed to that topic will receive a message.

We are using the latest firebase-admin and function versions.
